Planning a Big Island trip. Here's what made the cut:

☕ Hala Tree Coffee — small-batch farm, hourly tours, no tourist chaos
🌋 Volcanoes National Park — Kīlauea, lava tubes, the whole thing
🧂 Kona Sea Salt — yes, a salt farm tour. Trust me.
📍 Ka Lae — southernmost point in the US, because why not
🌅 Mauna Kea sunset — 13,800 ft, freezing cold, worth it

Plus a vanilla farm, a mac nut factory, and a fish market in Hilo.

This is what I do. Trips that actually make sense.

## Post 2: Hotel Upgrades (Insider Knowledge)

**Format:** Single image or text graphic

### Image options:
- Luxury hotel lobby: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/luxury-hotel-lobby
- Hotel room with view: https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hotel-room-view
- Or: Make a text graphic in Canva using brand colors (Terracotta, Cream, Charcoal)

How upgrades actually get decided.

After 15 years working in luxury hotels, here's what I can tell you:

It's not random. It's not "luck." And it's definitely not the $20 bill you slipped at check-in.

It's:
→ Booking direct (or through an advisor with preferred status)
→ Loyalty tier
→ Length of stay
→ How full the hotel is
→ Whether you're celebrating something (and told them in advance)

The upgrade is decided before you walk in the door. The front desk is just delivering the news.

## Post 3: Flight Routing (Aviation Nerd)

**Format:** Screenshot-based or Canva graphic

### Image options:
- Screenshot Google Flights showing two route options (you make this)
- Or: Airplane window shot from https://unsplash.com/s/photos/airplane-window
- Or: Airport terminal from https://unsplash.com/s/photos/airport-terminal

### Caption:

The flight everyone books vs. the one I'd book.

SFO → Maui, peak season.

❌ The obvious choice: Nonstop on Hawaiian or Alaska. $847 round trip, middle seat energy, no status perks.

✅ What I'd actually book: Connect through LAX on American. $612, lie-flat on the transcon, and you land 20 minutes later.

Same destination. Better seat. $235 back in your pocket.

This is the stuff I nerd out on.

## Post 4: "Why I Do This" / Intro Post

**Format:** Photo of you (or Canva text graphic)

### Image options:
- Use a photo of yourself (the one from the website works)
- Or: Canva text graphic with a quote

### Caption:
```
I spent 15 years working inside luxury hotels — Wynn, Cosmopolitan, Grand Hyatt.

I've seen what makes a stay actually great. And I've seen what happens when properties coast on reputation.

Now I help people find hotels that deserve their money. The right room, the upgrade waiting at check-in, the reservation that was "fully booked" until I called.

Not a booking engine. Not a template. Just someone who gives a damn about your trip.

That's Wyld Wandering.

## Post 5: Carousel — "5 Rooms You Should Never Book"

**Format:** Carousel (6 slides)

### Create in Canva:
Use brand colors (Terracotta #C75D3A, Cream #FAF7F2, Charcoal #2D2D2D)

| Slide | Text |
|:--|:--|
| 1 | 5 Rooms You Should Never Book |
| 2 | 1. The room right next to the elevator |
| 3 | 2. Ground floor facing the pool (unless you love watching strangers) |
| 4 | 3. "Garden view" at a beach resort (it means parking lot) |
| 5 | 4. The cheapest room at a luxury hotel (you'll feel it) |
| 6 | 5. Connecting rooms when you didn't ask for them — Want help finding the RIGHT room? Link in bio. |

After 15 years in hotels, here's what I'd avoid.

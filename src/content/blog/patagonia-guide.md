Patagonia has long been on the bucket list of adventure travelers worldwide, and for good reason. This region spanning southern Chile and Argentina offers some of the most dramatic landscapes on Earth.

## When to Visit

The best time to visit Patagonia is during the Southern Hemisphere summer, from November to March. December through February offers the warmest temperatures and longest days, making it ideal for hiking and outdoor activities.

Keep in mind that Patagonia is famous for its unpredictable weather. You can experience all four seasons in a single day, so come prepared for anything.

## Must-See Destinations

Torres del Paine National Park in Chile is the crown jewel of Patagonia, featuring the iconic granite towers, pristine lakes, and diverse wildlife. The W Trek and O Circuit are world-renowned hiking routes that attract thousands of visitors each year.

On the Argentine side, Los Glaciares National Park is home to the spectacular Perito Moreno Glacier, one of the few glaciers in the world that is still advancing.

## Planning Your Trip

I recommend spending at least 10-14 days in Patagonia to truly experience the region. This allows time for both Chilean and Argentine Patagonia, with flexibility for weather delays.
